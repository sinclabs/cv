      summary:
        "Svensk Travsport, being the organization that organizes and manages Trotting all over Sweden, it maintains a complicated software system to achieve uninterrupted racing all throughout the year along with safe and secure storing, retrieving and processing all the data. Their rich and long history means that the current sport system they use had become outdated and was in need of a revamp. Subramanian was brought in to lend his expertise in modern application development. Being one of the two developers in the team Subramanian was involved in investigating and implementing the backend and also in investigating the micro-frontend architecture. Subramanian built three micro-services -- two of them served REST APIs using ExpressJS in Node and one, in Node, managing data sync between an Oracle database and the Mongo DBs owned by the micro-services. He also was responsible for the implementation of the internal event pipeline based on NATS JetStream. In the early investigations, Subramanian evaluated different solutions such as Kafka and provided the team with insights to choose the right tech stack. Subramanian also conducted investigation on microfrontends architecture by comparing different solutions such as WebComponents, Webpack Module Federation and provided the team with the findings to be able to make the right decisions. Subramanian's effort in the project, proactiveness and collaborative team work helped the project succeed and lay a strong foundation for the future new sport system to be built.",
